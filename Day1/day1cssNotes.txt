a). Inline CSS- It is use when you want to apply css in small part or individual
part This is inline css ex-
<h1 style="background-color: maroon; color: blanchedalmond">
  First CSS Class Multiple Inline Css
</h1>
b). External CSS- we need to create individual css file and link in html page
ecternal css we use in multiple html pages at a time but inline and internal css
we can use only the same 1 html page not multiple html page at a time. You can
add mutilple css link but it makes page slow internal and inline css is faster
as campare to external css ex-
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../Day1/day1style.css" />
<h3>This is External css</h3>
<h3>
  we can use external css in multiple html pages at a time but we can not use
  inline css and internal css in html pages at a time
</h3>
h3{ background-color: yellowgreen; color: maroon; } c). Internal CSS- If you
want to apply css in group then use inline css ex-<style>
  p {
    background-color: palevioletred;
  }
</style>
<p>First CSS Class Internal css</p>

Q. I am applying the all 3 types of css in same tag which one will work? 
Ans-Inline css work its based on priority bases 
Inline css(highest priority)
Internal css(lower than inline) 
External css(lowest than inline) 

Class vs Id in
class and id have the same functionlity so id have more priority css apply first
of id one 

What is a selector? 
Different types of selector? 
Ans- Many types of selectors
1. Element selector
2. Class selector
3. Id selector
4. Universal selector

1. Element selector-  when u apply a css on a particular element its element selector ex- h1,h2,h3, audio,video,input ,body tag
All the container tags are the element selector.

2. Class selector- whatever you name .{dot}, class="" when you select a element with the help of class its class selector
selector means selecting somthing

3. Id Selector- when you use #name id="" its id selector

4. Universal selector- *{star} its universal selector
* means those element does not have property apply these property to it.

ID Selector - Highest priority
Class Selector- lower priority to id Selector
element selector - lower priority to id selector and class Selector
universal selector- lowest priority to id selector amd class selector and element Selector
Id Selector -> Class Selector -> Element Selector -> Universal Selector

body tag css- means apply these property only to body tag
